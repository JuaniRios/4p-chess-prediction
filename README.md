# 4p-chess-prediction

## Introduction

This is a project for Software Engineering and Project Management course at IMC Fachhochschule Krems.


#### Problem
	
The stakeholder is a professional competitor in 4-player chess.
In championship tournaments, the player names within games are hidden as colors and it is crucial for the players to try to guess which player is each color.
Due to the nature of the game, it is important to target the players that have already won a game within the bracket, thus creating a need for machine learning model
to try to identify each player-color combination.
